# Servo Library

The Servo library (Servo.py) is used to control a servo motor attached to the Arduino Expansion Board for Edison.

There are two additional examples to show how the library can be used. These examples are Sweep.py and Knob.py.

Both examples require being in the same directory where the servo library (Servo.py) is.

#### Sweep example
The sweep example shows how to use a servo motor attached to a PWM pin. The example will sweep the servo motor 
position from 0 to 180 degrees, and then from 180 to 0 degrees. This process is repeated indefinitely.

#### Knob example
The knob example shows how to control a servo motor attached to a PWM pin through a potentiometer. The example will 
move the servo motor position according to the knob position of the potentiometer.
